# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['John','Karen','Janet', 'Will']
# Simple for loop

# for person in people: 
#  print('Current person', person)    
# break
# for person in people: 
#  if person =='Karen': 
#   break 
#  print('Current person', person)   

# continue 
# for person in people: 
#  if person =='Janet': 
#   continue 
#  print('Current person', person)   

# Range
# for i in range(len(people)):
#   print('Current person', people[i])   


# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
