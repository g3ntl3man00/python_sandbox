# Strings in python are surrounded by either single or double quotation marks. Let's look at string formatting and some string methods
#name = 'Arman'
#age = 40
#print("My name is "+ str(name) +" and I am "+ str(age) +" years old!")





# String Formatting
# name = 'arman here was gud' 
# age = 23

# Concatenate
# print('My name is ' + name + 'and My age is ' +str (age)) 


#Arguments by position  
# print('{}, {}, {}'.format('a','b','c'))
# print('{1}, {2}, {0}'.format('a','b','c'))
  
# Argument by name 


# F-Strings (only in 3.6 and above ) 
# print(f'my name is {name} and I am {age}')

 
name = 'arman here was gud' 
age = 23
